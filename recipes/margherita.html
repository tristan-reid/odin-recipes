    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An Italian Margherita pizza is the most iconic style of Neapolitan pizza, 
    known for its simplicity, freshness, and balance of flavors. 
    It’s made with a thin, soft, and slightly chewy crust that puffs up around the 
    edges when baked at very high heat.</p>
    <p>It’s celebrated as the perfect example of how a few high-quality ingredients 
    can create something extraordinary. The following section contains the ingredients
    list for this dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250 g) all-purpose or “00” flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (180 ml) warm water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp active dry yeast (or 8 g fresh yeast)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 g) canned San Marzano tomatoes (crushed or pureed)</li>
        <li>6–8 oz (170–225 g) fresh mozzarella (preferably mozzarella di bufala)</li>
        <li>6–8 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1–2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Make the Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil, then mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead on a floured surface for about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare The Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush or blend San Marzano tomatoes into a smooth puree.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt (and optionally a drizzle of olive oil).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the fresh mozzarella into thin pieces.</li>
        <li>Pat lightly with a paper towel to remove excess moisture (prevents soggy pizza).</li>
        <li>Keep fresh basil leaves whole.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Pizza</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven as hot as it can go (ideally 475–500°F / 250–260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it inside while preheating.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide into balls (1 ball = 1 pizza).</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, stretch or roll one ball into a thin circle (about 12 inches).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 5: Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about 1 inch around the edge.</li>
        <li>Evenly distribute the mozzarella slices.</li>
        <li>Add a few fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Drizzle lightly with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the hot oven (onto the stone or a baking sheet).</li>
        <li>Bake for 7–10 minutes (or 90 seconds if using a wood-fired oven)</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool for 1–2 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 7: Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Garnish with a touch more fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately — Italian pizza is best eaten hot and fresh!</li>
    </ol>
