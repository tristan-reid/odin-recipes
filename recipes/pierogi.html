        <li>Mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>

        smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Wrap in plastic or cover with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Meat Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter/oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook another minute.</li>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pierogi</h3>

    </ol>

        <li>Drop pierogi in batches (don’t overcrowd).</li>
        <li>Stir gently so they don’t stick to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cook until they float to the surface + 1–2 minutes (about 4–5 minutes total).</li>
